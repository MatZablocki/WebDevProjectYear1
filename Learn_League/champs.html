					<h3 class="champs">Top Lane<br>Garen</h3>
					<img class="champ_img" id="garen" alt="garen" src="Assets/Images/garen1.jpg"/>
					<h5>Garen's abilities</h5>

					<p>Garen regenerates a small portion of his max hp every 5s, Garen loses Perseverance if he takes damage from a champion, turret or epic monster.</p>
					
					<h4>Q : Decisive Strike</h4>
					<img class="ability" alt="garen_q" src="Assets/Images/garen_q.jpg" />
					<p>Garen cleanses himself of all slows and gains 30% bonus movement speed for a few seconds. Additionally garens next basic attack does bonus physical damage and silences the targer for 1.5s.</p>
					
					<h4>W : Courage</h4>
					<img class="ability" alt="garen_w" src="Assets/Images/garen_w.jpg" />
					<p>Passive: garen premanently gains 0.25 bonus armor and magic resiste every time he kills an enemy, up to a max of 30.<br>Active: Garen reduces incoming damage by 30% and gains a shield for a few seconds.</p>
					
					<h4>E : Judgement</h4>
					<img class="ability" alt="garen_e" src="Assets/Images/garen_e.jpg" />
					<p>Garen rapidly spins in place for a few seconds dealing damage to all enemies around him and shredding the enemies armour, he cannot basic attack during this duration.</p>

					<h5>Q - AA - E - R</h5>
					<iframe class="combo" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S5ub9CkUTuA" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>				
					<h5>Runes and Builds</h5>
					<p>This is the standard runepage for Garen, you can run this pretty much every game and it will be good. There are some variations but i dont want to make this guide any more complicated. Switch between Armour and MR for the quints depending on what champion youre against. For summoner spells you can go Flash and Teleport.</p>
					<img class="runes" alt="garen_runes" src="Assets/Images/garen_runes.png" />
					<h5>Items</h5>
					<p>When playing Garen there are a variaty of Items you can build. In this section i will only cover one sample build.</p>
					<img class="build" alt="garen_build" src="Assets/Images/garen_build.png" />
					<p>Stridebreaker is a great first item as Garens primary weakness is his lack of mobility, using the active combined with his Q makes it easyer to get on top of targets. For boots you can chose between mercs and steelcaps depending on what the enemy team composition is, if they are heavy AD go steelcaps if they are heavy AP/CC go mercs, same goes for the next item, Dead Mans Plate and Force of Nature both give movement speed which is a great stat for Garen, build whichever fits more. If the enemy team has an even amount of AP and AD you can build both. Steraks Gage is another great item as the shield along with the AD is good for Garen. Black Cleaver adds even more armour shred to your kit and Deaths Dance is a great last item overall as it gives you even more survivability.</p>

					<h5>Items</h5>
					<p>Warwick has a pretty standard build. He usually builds the same first few items and then choses the rest based on the enemy teams damage types.</p>
					<img class="build" alt="warwick_build" src="Assets/Images/warw_build.png" />
					<p>Sunfire Aegis is an excellent item right now and since warwick can buid it effectivly you should start this every game. Boots are a standard choice of Mercs or Steelguards depending on the enemy team. Titanic hydra works very well with your kit as the extra attackspeed from your W lets it proc a lot more. Steraks Gage is a great item and gives you some extra survivability. For the last two items build whichever one the enemy team has more damage for first then the other one after. </p>

Zhonyas Hourglass is one of the strongest items in the game as it lets you survive an extra few seconds which is very valuable. Void Staff gives 40% magic penetration so its good even against a team of squishies but if theres tanks its even more effective. Rylais is good on annie as it causes the aura tibbers has to constantly slow enemies allowing you to get an extra ability off before they can run. Deathcap is the best last item for all mages as it gives 40% bonus AP which is more effincient later game.</p>

					<img alt="tristana_ build" class="build" src="Assets/Images/trist_build.png" />
					<p>You should build Kraken Slayer first as you want to auto fast to stack up your E bomb so the extra damage is good. Berserkers Greaves are a staple for all ADC's. The Stormrazor slow will let you get off an extra auto attack as well as the extra damage being good. Infinity Edge third item as it gives the most DPS and is madatory in most Crit builds. Rapidfire Cannon gives you extra range which is good late game as your passive gives you range also. Bloodthirster last item is my favourite as it gives you lifesteal to let you survive fights as well as heal to full right after them.</p>

					<p>You should build Boots of Mobility first as they will allow you to play a lot more aggressive in lane as well as let you roam to other lanes. You go Imperial Mandate first as it provides a lot of damage and synergizes with your kit. Zhonyas is also a must have item on morgana as it allows her to R then zhonyas which will guarantee the stun to hit them as they cant kill you before hand and when you come out of stasis they are stunned. You go redempion third as it gives you more utility which you lack. Demonic Embrace is a strong item as it gives you more burn as well as some resistances. Vigilant Wardstone is a must buy on supports as it lets you have more vision which is very important.</p>
